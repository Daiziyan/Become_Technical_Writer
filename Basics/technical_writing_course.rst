who you’re writing for

- Users. Users are people who simply want to use your code, and don’t care how it works.
- Developers. Developers are people who want to contribute back to your code.

What problem your project solves
-----------------------------------

You should explain what your project does and why it exists.

- what is it?
- How is it  used?
- Code example (a telling example of what your project would normally be used for)
- Contribute
- Support
- FAQs












Paragraphs
--------------------

.. tip::

    The work of writing is simply this: untangling the dependencies among the parts of a topic, and presenting those parts in a logical stream that enables the reader to understand you.


Good paragraphs answer the following three questions:

- What are you trying to tell your reader?
- Why is it important for the reader to know this?
- How should the reader use this knowledge? Alternatively, how should the reader know your point to be true?


Audience
-----------------

.. tip::

    good documentation = knowledge and skills your audience needs to do a task − your audience's current knowledge and skills
